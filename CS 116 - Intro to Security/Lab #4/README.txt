- discussed assignment with Peter Smiley

- approximately worked on this assignment for 7 hours

- The heuristics used in this assignment are good because they accurately detect scans

- If I had spare time in the future, I would add more conditionals per scan so there would be absolutely no discrepancies between a blatant scan and a weird but real request.
