My cracking methodology was to first split up all the passwords into three files based on the type of encryption. Then, I used John the Ripper on all three files and used the Kali-provided rockyou.txt file and also Daniel Miessler's 10 million password file (https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/xato-net-10-million-passwords.txt) as the word lists.
