In October, Adidas severed its business alliance with the rapper, who is now known as Ye, after he went on an antisemitic rant. An immediate priority for Mr. Gulden (who was poached from Adidas’s crosstown rival, Puma) is figuring out how to sell the mountain of unsold inventory from the Yeezy line.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/10/business/dealbook/adidas-shares-kanye-west.html"}
