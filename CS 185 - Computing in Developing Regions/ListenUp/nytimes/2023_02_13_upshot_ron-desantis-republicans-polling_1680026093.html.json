It’s a question I’ve been hearing a lot lately.\nThe premise is that there’s an important similarity between the two: They both earned the affection of conservatives by “owning the libs” as governors, rather than by giving soaring speeches or otherwise demonstrating the skills to win a presidential nomination.\nIn the end, Mr. Walker’s success in Wisconsin did not translate to the national stage; the implication is that Mr. DeSantis’s success in Florida might not translate either. A wave of articles over the last few weeks has questioned whether he has the charisma, charm and likability to win the nomination. If he falters, the ending of his campaign might read a like lot the story of Walker for President.\nBut, at least at the beginning of the race, Mr. DeSantis is no Scott Walker. He would start the campaign in a very different and far stronger position, even if there is still no way to know whether he “has what it takes” to succeed against former President Donald J. Trump.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/13/upshot/ron-desantis-republicans-polling.html"}
