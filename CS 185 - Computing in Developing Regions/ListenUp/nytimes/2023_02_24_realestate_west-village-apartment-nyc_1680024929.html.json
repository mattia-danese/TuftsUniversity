But not Michael Ingram Jones.\nWhen he began looking to return to New York from San Francisco, size was a secondary concern, because he considered the city to be his larger living room. More important, by far, was the neighborhood where he wanted to live: the West Village. And the specific type of building he hoped to live in: a prewar apartment house built by Bing & Bing.\nIn the early 20th century, the storied New York developers constructed a handful of buildings in the West Village, “and I would have lived in any of them,” said Mr. Ingram Jones, a fashion designer in his 60s, who lived in a Bing & Bing building at 302 West 12th Street before moving to San Francisco in 2007, to serve as the senior vice president of design for Old Navy.\n“I wanted to travel a lot, so I wanted a space that was secure,” he said. “And these buildings have good security. You can just lock them up and go away for a few weeks or a few months.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/24/realestate/west-village-apartment-nyc.html"}
