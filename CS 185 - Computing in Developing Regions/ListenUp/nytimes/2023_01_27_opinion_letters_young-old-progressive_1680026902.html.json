I do not think I am unique in this perspective.\nThe institutions of our democracy, equal justice, economic equity, climate change and protection of civil liberties are not just issues for the moment, but also determine the future of young people and the old people who care about them.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/27/opinion/letters/young-old-progressive.html"}
