Moore, shield No. 424, has worn the blue patrol uniform of a New York Times security officer longer than anyone else on the current force. At age 69, he will retire soon.\nMr. Moore was born and lives on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. He has many stories about guarding The Times’s headquarters at 620 Eighth Avenue and, before that, at 229 West 43rd Street, off Times Square. Only some are fit to print.\nWhen he arrived in 1981, Times Square was dicey — illicit sex, gambling, off-hour drinking, loan-sharking. And that was inside the building.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/05/insider/patrolling-the-times.html"}
