We must speed up the events, speed up the supply and opening of new necessary weaponry options for Ukraine.”\nOn Monday, President Biden, asked by a reporter whether the United States would provide F-16 fighter jets — which are on Ukraine’s wish list — said it would not. The White House declined to comment on a question about whether Mr. Biden was ruling out the use of the jets entirely or just an immediate transfer of them.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/30/world/europe/ukraine-weapons.html"}
