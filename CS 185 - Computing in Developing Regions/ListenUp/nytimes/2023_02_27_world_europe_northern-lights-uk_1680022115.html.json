To his surprise, he saw the aurora’s pink flush above the dark trees.\n“I would have never expected that to happen here,” said Mr. Rabinowitz, who had taken trips to Norway and Finland to see the northern lights before. “It was crazy really.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/27/world/europe/northern-lights-uk.html"}
