As the late shift ended and people in hairnets began to emerge from the building, I saw that many of them were short and baby faced. But there was another problem: The workers didnâ€™t have coats and they were running through a November cold snap to find their car pools. I asked myself how I was going to talk to them without seeming like a stranger chasing children through the snow.\nThis was my last stop for a project that had led me to seven states and entailed interviews with more than 100 migrant children working exploitative jobs across the country.\nIn the last two years, more than 250,000 children have entered the United States by themselves, many of them from Central America. I found that thousands of them had ended up in punishing jobs that flouted child labor laws. Children as young as 12 and 13 year olds are working in commercial laundromats, industrial bakeries and sock mills.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/03/insider/searching-for-the-faces-of-child-migrant-labor.html"}
