But beyond the mere fact of his announcement Wednesday that he is retiring from the N.F.L., there is a lot more to know.\nWho is Tom Brady?\nWait, seriously? You don’t know Tom Brady, the superstar N.F.L. quarterback who has won seven Super Bowls?\nJust kidding, I know who Brady is. But could you briefly review his career for me anyway?\nBrady grew up in Northern California and played college football at Michigan. But he was unheralded enough to be drafted only in the sixth round by the New England Patriots in 2000, a slight he has used as motivation throughout his career.\nThe pick was a steal, as Brady led the Patriots to six Super Bowl victories. He moved on to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as a free agent and won a seventh Super Bowl, the most by any player. He was named M.V.P. in five of those Super Bowls.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/01/sports/football/tom-brady-retired-career.html"}
