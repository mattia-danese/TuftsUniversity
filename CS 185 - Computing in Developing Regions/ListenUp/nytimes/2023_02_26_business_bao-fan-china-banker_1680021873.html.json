It did not say where Mr. Bao was or identify the matter in which he is supposedly cooperating. Chinese media has reported that the government called on Mr. Bao to assist in an investigation related to a former China Renaissance executive.\nThe latest news followed the company’s disclosure on Feb. 16 that it had been “unable to contact” Mr. Bao. The announcement sent the company’s stock price plunging and the stock has not fully recovered.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/26/business/bao-fan-china-banker.html"}
