Officials have pledged to fortify the northern land border with Turkey by extending a fence and adding guards.\nTensions between Greece and Turkey have been rising in recent months over a series of issues, including territorial disputes and migration, raising the specter of a conflict between the two neighbors, who have long had an uneasy relationship.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/10/world/europe/greece-trial-migrants.html"}
