Public safety, he often says, is a “prerequisite for prosperity,” the foundation beneath his push to improve the city’s economy and get people back to offices and restaurants.\nBut running a city with eight million people and a $100 billion budget is a complex endeavor, and Mr. Adams quickly faced criticism on many fronts: cronyism in his administration, painful budget cuts at some schools and a seeming lack of urgency in addressing New York’s affordability crisis.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/01/nyregion/eric-adams-mayor.html"}
