It had earlier climbed more than 1.7 percent, but gave up that gain before climbing again.\nThe big swings this week have come as investors have wrestled with the impact of the Federal Reserve’s rapid interest-rate increases on the banking system. On Wednesday, the Fed raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, continuing its campaign to dampen inflation. It was the ninth increase in borrowing costs in a year.\nBut the Fed also acknowledged that it may be near the end of its rate-raising cycle, and that turmoil in the banking system, set off by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this month, could push it to pause. If banks pull back on lending as a result of turbulence in the financial system, making it harder for consumers to borrow and spend, that could dampen inflation by slowing the economy.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/23/business/stock-market-today.html"}
