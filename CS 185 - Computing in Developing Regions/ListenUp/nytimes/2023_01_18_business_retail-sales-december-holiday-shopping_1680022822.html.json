While the data is adjusted for seasonal variations, it does not account for price changes, and inflation continued to ease during December, which would have contributed to the decline.\nRetail sales in November were also revised to show a fall of 1 percent from October, worse than the 0.6 percent decline originally reported.\nSales were down in December at popular holiday shopping destinations like electronics stores, car dealerships and clothing outlets. Department stores posted a 6.6 percent decline from the previous month.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/18/business/retail-sales-december-holiday-shopping.html"}
