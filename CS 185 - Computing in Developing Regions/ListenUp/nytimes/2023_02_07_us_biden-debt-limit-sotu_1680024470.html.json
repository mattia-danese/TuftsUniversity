Those talks, which started last week, are shaping up to be the biggest legislative fight in Washington this year.\nThe United States hit the $31.4 trillion borrowing cap last month, forcing the Treasury Department to employ so-called extraordinary measures to delay a default. Republicans are seeking to use the debt limit standoff to gain concessions from Democrats and force spending cuts. Democrats point out that raising the debt limit does not authorize any new spending and simply allows the government to pay for spending that Congress has already authorized. Economists roundly agree that it would be catastrophic for the economy if the United States did not pay its bills and defaulted on its debt by failing to make required payments to U.S. bondholders.\nAlthough raising the debt limit is an urgent matter, it is not clear how much time lawmakers have to get it done. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen suggested that her ability to move federal money around and stave off a default could be exhausted by early June, but that will depend on a variety of factors such as how fast the economy is growing and how much tax revenue comes in.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/07/us/biden-debt-limit-sotu.html"}
