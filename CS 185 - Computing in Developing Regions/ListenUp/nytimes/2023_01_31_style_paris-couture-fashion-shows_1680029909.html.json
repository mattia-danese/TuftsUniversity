Last week, on both the runway and the street, the outfits furthest outside the box were some of the most exciting to see.\nAt the Schiaparelli show, there was the sculpted lion’s head (and attached dress) worn by Kylie Jenner, followed by a small parade of lifelike faux taxidermy sent down the runway. At Viktor & Rolf, there were ball gowns worn upside down and sideways. At Iris van Herpen, there were dresses that looked like butterflies in metamorphosis. On the street, there were double-breasted suits with epic proportions, poufy skirts that pooled on the sidewalk and other dramatic looks — the best of which channeled the fantasy of the garments being presented at shows.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/31/style/paris-couture-fashion-shows.html"}
