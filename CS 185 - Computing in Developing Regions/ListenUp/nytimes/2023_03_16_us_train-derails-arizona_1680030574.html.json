In Wednesday night’s derailment, the Mohave County Sheriff’s Office said there had been hazardous materials on board the train operated by BNSF, briefly raising fears of another airborne toxic event.\nBut in a statement early Thursday, a spokeswoman for BNSF said that the train had been carrying corn syrup when it derailed around 7:40 p.m.\n“There were no injuries as a result of the derailment and preliminarily reports indicate there are no hazardous materials involved,” the spokeswoman, Lena Kent, said. She added that an estimated eight train cars had derailed and that the cause was under investigation.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/16/us/train-derails-arizona.html"}
