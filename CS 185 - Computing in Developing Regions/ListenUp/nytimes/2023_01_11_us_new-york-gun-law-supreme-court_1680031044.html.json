Challenges to the new law are pending before the federal appeals court in New York.\nIn a statement, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, said the law “presents novel and serious questions.” But he added that the appeals court should address those questions first, so long as it does so promptly.\nThe law, enacted in July, requires people seeking gun licenses to show that they have “good moral character” and bans guns in many public locations. In addition, the law bans guns on private property unless the owner consents to their presence.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/11/us/new-york-gun-law-supreme-court.html"}
