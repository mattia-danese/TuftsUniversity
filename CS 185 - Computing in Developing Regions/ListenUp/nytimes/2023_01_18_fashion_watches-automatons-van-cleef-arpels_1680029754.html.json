It could be a wristwatch like Jaquet Droz’s The Dragon, which has the winged serpent breathe fire and flick its tail.\nThe one thing that is certain is that an automaton timepiece will contain elaborate and highly synchronized moving parts that create a balletic moment, all the while telling what time it is.\nExamples, especially from the automaton’s glory days of the 18th century, can be found in museums. But some new ones on the scene are creating motions that horologists of the past likely never imagined.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/18/fashion/watches-automatons-van-cleef-arpels.html"}
