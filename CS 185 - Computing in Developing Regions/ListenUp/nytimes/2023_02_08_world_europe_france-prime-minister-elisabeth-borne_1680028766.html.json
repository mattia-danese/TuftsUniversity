But what she did not say was that she could relate.\nMs. Borne’s youth was full of trauma. Her father survived Auschwitz-Birkenau, the notorious Nazi camp where one million Jews were killed, and died by suicide when she was 11. He left behind a bankrupted business and a shell of a wife. His daughter was taken under the wing of the state and left home at 16.\nNow, she is only the second woman ever to become France’s prime minister, serving as the right hand of President Emmanuel Macron and the public face of his unpopular plan to overhaul France’s pension system, which has drawn millions of people onto the streets to protest.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/08/world/europe/france-prime-minister-elisabeth-borne.html"}
