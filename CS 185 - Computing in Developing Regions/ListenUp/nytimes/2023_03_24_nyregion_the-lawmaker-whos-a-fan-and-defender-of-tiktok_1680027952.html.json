Why has Representative Bowman become TikTok’s unofficial defender?\nBasically, Bowman believes that there has been a rush to judgment in Washington simply because TikTok is owned by a Chinese company.\nThe backdrop here is important. The United States and China are increasingly in competition and conflict with each other for global influence. President Biden and many lawmakers in both parties fear that Chinese authorities could force TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, to hand over data on TikTok’s 150 million U.S. users, such as their approximate location or browsing history — or that Beijing could exploit TikTok to spread misinformation. That helped to explain the adversarial tone of Thursday’s hearing before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.\nBut Bowman says he has not seen any evidence that China is exerting undue influence over TikTok, and he opposes shutting down a popular app without better reasons. (TikTok’s chief executive, Shou Chew, denied at the hearing that ByteDance is controlled by the Chinese government. He also said that TikTok was not a national security risk.)\nI also think Bowman just really likes TikTok. He started using it in 2021, has 159,000 followers and says it is a great way to communicate with young constituents and activists. Some of his videos are actually pretty funny.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/24/nyregion/the-lawmaker-whos-a-fan-and-defender-of-tiktok.html"}
