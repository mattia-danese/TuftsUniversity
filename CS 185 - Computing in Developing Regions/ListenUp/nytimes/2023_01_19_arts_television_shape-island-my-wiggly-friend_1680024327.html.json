Everything on “Gemstones” operates with a “blessed are the flamboyant” vibe: the set design, the nicknames, the church services, the costuming, even the way the characters pray.

So far there are two seasons, and a third is on the way.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/19/arts/television/shape-island-my-wiggly-friend.html"}
