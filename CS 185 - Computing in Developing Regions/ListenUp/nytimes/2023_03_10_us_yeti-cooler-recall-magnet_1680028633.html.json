The recalled products were sold between March 2018 and January 2023, including nearly 41,000 products in Canada, through retailers like Dick’s Sporting Goods and Ace Hardware and online through Yeti and Amazon.\nYeti said in a statement that it was cooperating with the agency and voluntarily recalling the products.\nThe commission urged consumers to stop using the products immediately, after receiving nearly 1,400 reports of the magnet-lined closures failing, falling off or going missing. No magnet ingestions or injuries from Yeti products have been reported.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/10/us/yeti-cooler-recall-magnet.html"}
