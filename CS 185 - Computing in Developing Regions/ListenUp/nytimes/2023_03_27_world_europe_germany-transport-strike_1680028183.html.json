The walkout, by 155,000 workers, was the largest transport workers’ action since a series of strikes in the 1990s and amounted to a warning shot about what could happen this time if negotiations fail.\nThe strike “is intended to make it unmistakably clear to the employers once again that the employees clearly stand behind our demands,” said Frank Werneke, the head of Verdi.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/27/world/europe/germany-transport-strike.html"}
