James Spitler, sector commander of the U.S. Coast Guard in San Diego, said that one boat carrying approximately eight people made it ashore, while the other, carrying an estimated 15 people, overturned in the surf. Seven of the people who died are believed to have been Mexican nationals, based on identification that they were carrying, the Consulate General of Mexico in San Diego said in a statement on Monday.\nJames Gartland, the head of the San Diego Fire-Rescue Department’s lifeguard division, called the deaths “one of the worst maritime smuggling tragedies” in recent years.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/12/us/san-diego-drownings.html"}
