Kennedy, died on Jan. 9 in Montreal. He was 93.\nHis son Andrew confirmed the death, in a care facility.\nMr. Zimbel (rhymes with “thimble”) captured people in the act of living: A sailor reading in his lower bunk on a submarine. A small boy dwarfed by a Great Dane in Harlem. A little girl playing hopscotch in the street. A baby pulling on a doctor’s stethoscope. A boy pointing a toy gun at a friend. Musicians and exotic dancers in New Orleans nightclubs.\nIn 1954, Mr. Zimbel entered an Irish dance hall in the Bronx and found a scene that he cast in noirish light: A young man, in the foreground, his hair tousled and his tie loose, turns toward five young women in the background who appear hopeful that they will be asked to dance — but who do not seem to be hoping that he’s the one who will ask.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/27/arts/george-zimbel-dead.html"}
