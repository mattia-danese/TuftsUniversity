A plurality of Americans say that we’re in a recession; the actual numbers on jobs and gross domestic product show an economy that remains quite strong.\nIndeed, gut-based analysis may be even worse these days than it was in the past, given how much economic views are affected by partisanship: Republicans rate the economy worse now than they did in June 1980, when unemployment was 7.6 percent and inflation was 14 percent.\nOn the other hand, hard data isn’t necessarily as hard as you think. This isn’t a criticism of the statistical agencies, which are doing the best they can and should be given more resources. (It would be really helpful right now if the Employment Cost Index were released monthly rather than only once a quarter, for example.)\nBut many of the numbers you see aren’t based on direct observation of economic transactions. They are instead “imputed” numbers that are, in effect, educated guesses about what the numbers would be if we could observe them directly.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/27/opinion/inflation-housing-data.html"}
