Storms this winter have dumped so intensely across the Sierra Nevada that on Wednesday he simply walked up a massive snowbank to the top of his house.\n“There’s about 14 feet from the edge of that roof to the floor,” said Mr. Culp, who has lived for 25 years in the Tahoe Donner community near the mountain pass and lake also named after the pioneering party that met an unfortunate demise many winters ago.\nIn recent weeks, blizzards have shut the interstate, closed popular Tahoe ski resorts and sent semi trucks careening into snowbanks. But after weeks of dealing with an icy mess, residents in the mountains worried about a series of warm rainstorms from the tropics that were expected to arrive by late Thursday.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/09/us/california-snow-roofs-lake-tahoe.html"}
