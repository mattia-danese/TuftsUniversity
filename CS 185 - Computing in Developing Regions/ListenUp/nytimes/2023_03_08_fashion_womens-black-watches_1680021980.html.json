In 1954, Mr. Dior wrote of his respect for black in his “Little Dictionary of Fashion.” “I could write a whole book on black.” Inspired by his legacy, the house in September dressed a new model of its La D de Dior watch in a 34-millimeter round case featuring a black dial adorned with three black-diamond markers.\nThe black watch is the ultimate fashion accessory, according to Jean-Claude Biver, who was chief executive when Hublot unveiled the Big Bang All Black — which, with its black case, dial, hands and indices, made it difficult, if not impossible, to tell the time.\n“Do you really buy a watch to know what time it is, or do you buy it because you enjoy the aesthetic?” he said. “The time indication has become secondary. An all-black watch is a provocation: ‘Have you seen my watch?’ It’s chic to say, ‘I don’t see what time it is, I can always look my iPhone.’\n“Time is not essential today,” he added. “In the beginning of the last century, watches had one purpose: to tell time. Today, watches have different roles. They are symbols of richness, or strength.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/fashion/womens-black-watches.html"}
