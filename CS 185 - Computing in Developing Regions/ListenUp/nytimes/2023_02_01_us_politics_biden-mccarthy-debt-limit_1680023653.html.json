The president has said repeatedly that he expects Congress to raise the borrowing cap with no conditions — and that he will not negotiate conditions for an increase.\nAfter the meeting, the White House said Mr. Biden repeated to Mr. McCarthy that he would not negotiate on the limit. But the president did say he welcomes a “separate discussion with congressional leaders about how to reduce the deficit and control the national debt while continuing to grow the economy,” according to a White House summary of the meeting.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/01/us/politics/biden-mccarthy-debt-limit.html"}
