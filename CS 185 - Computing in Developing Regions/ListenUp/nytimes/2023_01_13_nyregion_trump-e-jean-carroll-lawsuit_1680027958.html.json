Trump’s effort to dismiss a lawsuit in which the writer E. Jean Carroll accuses Mr. Trump of raping her in a dressing room at a Fifth Avenue department store in the mid-1990s.\nIn letting the suit proceed, the judge, Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court in Manhattan, upheld a 2022 New York law that gives adults who claim to have been sexually assaulted years ago a one-time window to sue those they say abused them even if the period for doing so under the statute of limitations has long since expired.\nIn his ruling, which the law’s chief State Senate sponsor described as a first in New York, Judge Kaplan labeled “absurd” Mr. Trump’s argument that the legislation violated the state’s Constitution.\nMs. Carroll, an author and a former longtime advice columnist for Elle magazine, sued Mr. Trump on Nov. 24, the start of the period in which the law, the Adult Survivors Act, allows such suits to be brought.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/13/nyregion/trump-e-jean-carroll-lawsuit.html"}
