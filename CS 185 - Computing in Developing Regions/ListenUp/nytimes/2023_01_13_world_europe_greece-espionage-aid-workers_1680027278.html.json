We want this to go to trial,” one of the accused, Sean Binder, an Irish rescue diver, told reporters outside court on Friday. Noting that the outcome was not an exoneration, he said he feared more years of “waiting and errors.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/13/world/europe/greece-espionage-aid-workers.html"}
