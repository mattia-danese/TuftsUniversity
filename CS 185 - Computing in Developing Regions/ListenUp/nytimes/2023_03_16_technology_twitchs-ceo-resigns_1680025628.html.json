He said that Dan Clancy, Twitch’s president, would take over as chief executive, and that Mr. Shear would remain at Twitch in an advisory role.\n“Twitch often feels to me like a child I’ve been raising as well,” he wrote. “And while I will always want to be there if Twitch needs me, at 16 years old it feels to me Twitch is ready to move out of the house and venture alone.”\nMr. Shear leaves a platform with big challenges, but also one that has grown drastically in recent years and become the cultural center of the video game world. Now, livestreamers who broadcast themselves gaming, cooking or chatting with fans can attract audiences of thousands and earn millions of dollars on the site, which is owned by Amazon.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/16/technology/twitchs-ceo-resigns.html"}
