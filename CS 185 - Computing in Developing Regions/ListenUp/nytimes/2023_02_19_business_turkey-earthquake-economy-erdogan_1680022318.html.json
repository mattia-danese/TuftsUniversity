As the only NATO country not to participate in international sanctions, Turkey has converted the Russian oil in its refineries to be sold to the European Union and the United States, according to an analysis by the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air in Finland.\nAnother $20 billion has flowed to Turkey from a long-term deal in which Moscow provided financing for the construction of the Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant, a 4,800-megawatt reactor being built on the Mediterranean near an eastern earthquake fault line by Rosatom, Russia’s state-owned nuclear power provider.\nOn top of that, an additional $24 billion in funds of unidentified origin helped to finance half of a record deficit that Turkey racked up last year from importing more goods and services than it exported. Some of that mystery money, reported in 2022 data published by the government last week under the obscure heading “Net Errors and Omissions,” is thought to be of Russian provenance, Mr. Ash noted.\nHeaded into the presidential elections, “Erdogan will use all imaginable means to stay in power,” Mr. Pierini said.\n“Irrespective of the reconstruction effort and whatever flow of money might be generated,” he said, “the economic outlook is linked to the result of the upcoming election, because there is the possibility that for the first time in 20 years he could be defeated.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/19/business/turkey-earthquake-economy-erdogan.html"}
