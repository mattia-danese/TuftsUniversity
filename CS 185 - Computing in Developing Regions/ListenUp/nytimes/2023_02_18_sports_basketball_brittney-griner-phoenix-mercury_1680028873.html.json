The State Department declared Griner wrongfully detained and sought a prisoner exchange for her release.\nAn exchange was made in December, with Griner being returned to the United States while Viktor Bout, an arms dealer who had been convicted nearly a decade earlier, was sent back to Russia.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/18/sports/basketball/brittney-griner-phoenix-mercury.html"}
