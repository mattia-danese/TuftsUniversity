So last year he asked Kross Studio, a Swiss luxury watch brand that specializes in pop culture themes, to make a custom timepiece.\nMarco Tedeschi, the company’s founder and creative director, agreed — and now the brand is offering to make versions of the watch for other clients.\nThe design of the 45-millimeter tourbillon has several nods to Wonder Woman iconography from DC Comics, including the W logo that resembles a stylized eagle, which is affixed above the tourbillon cage. There are also representations of her Lasso of Truth and her shield; her tiara, which serves as the watch’s minute disk pointer; and her sword, the hour hand.\nIncorporating all the motifs proved to be a technical challenge, Mr. Tedeschi wrote in an email: “In most watches, the dial is attached to the movement before being placed in the watch case. However, for the Wonder Woman tourbillon, the design dictated that half of the Lasso of Truth be fixed to the case and half integrated into the movement, making the casing process more challenging. We had to design a completely new movement, for a single piece.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/fashion/watch-wonder-woman-kross-studio-switzerland.html"}
