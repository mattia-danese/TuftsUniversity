Putin of Russia invaded, in 2008. Despite losing a chunk of its territory to Moscow in that conflict, Georgia’s government has increasingly tilted toward Russia and away from the West.\nHere is some background on Georgia and the demonstrations.\nThe protests focus on a proposed law surrounding ‘foreign agents.’\nLawmakers this week gave initial support to a draft law that would require any organization that receives more than 20 percent of its funding from overseas to register as a foreign agent or risk a hefty fine. The protesters say they fear it would harm the country’s chances of joining the European Union.\nThe protesters note that a similar law in Russia has been used to stifle freedom of expression by cracking down on rights groups and other independent organizations.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/world/europe/georgia-protests-russia-ukraine.html"}
