Austin III made an unannounced visit to Iraq on Tuesday to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to the country, less than two weeks before the 20th anniversary of the American-led invasion that transformed the Middle Eastern nation.\nAfter meetings with Iraq’s prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, and his top military and counterterrorism team, Mr. Austin assured Iraqi leaders that the United States would press on with the mission of advising and training the country’s armed forces.\n“U.S. forces are ready to remain in Iraq at the invitation of the government of Iraq,” he said after meeting Iraqi leaders.\nThe 2003 invasion of Iraq ousted the longstanding dictator Saddam Hussein and led to a brutal insurgency against U.S. forces and their Iraqi allies. It set off sectarian warfare and spurred the growth of Al Qaeda in Iraq, later paving the way for the rise of the Islamic State as well.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/07/world/middleeast/iraq-lloyd-austin-us-invasion-anniversary.html"}
