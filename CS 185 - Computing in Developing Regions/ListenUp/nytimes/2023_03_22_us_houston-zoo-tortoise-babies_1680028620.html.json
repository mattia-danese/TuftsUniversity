(All three names are comfortably in the family of pickle preserves.)\nIt was an astounding feat, zoo officials said, not only because Mr. Pickles is 90 years old, but also because the critically endangered species rarely produces offspring.\nMr. Pickles has been a resident of the zoo for 36 years and partnered with Mrs. Pickles, now 53, since her arrival in 1996. While radiated tortoises can live for up to 150 years, exactly how long they can reproduce is unknown, said Jessica Reyes, a zoo spokeswoman.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/22/us/houston-zoo-tortoise-babies.html"}
