Col. Rodolphe Sorgho, said in a statement.\nNo group had claimed responsibility as of Monday, but extremist groups linked to Al Qaeda and the Islamic State have for years carried out attacks and kidnappings in Burkina Faso, killing tens of thousands and displacing nearly two million people — 10 percent of the country’s population.\nUntil recently, however, women could move more easily in rural areas than men, often walking for days from displacement camps back to the villages they fled to check on their crops and houses.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/16/world/africa/kidnapping-burkina-faso.html"}
