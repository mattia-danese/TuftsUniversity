The device was smaller than a penny, while the search zone was an 870-mile stretch of highway cutting across vast tracts of desert.\nBut the search took just six days, with the authorities announcing on Wednesday afternoon that the capsule had been recovered in what they called an “extraordinary result.”\n“The search crews have literally found the needle in the haystack,” Stephen Dawson, the emergency services minister for Western Australia state, said at a news conference.\nThe authorities had launched the large-scale search, involving the defense force, emergency services and radiation experts, after the capsule was discovered to be missing last week.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/01/world/asia/australia-radioactive-capsule.html"}
