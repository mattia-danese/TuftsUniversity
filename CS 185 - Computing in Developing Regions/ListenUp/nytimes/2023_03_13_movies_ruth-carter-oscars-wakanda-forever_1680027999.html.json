Carter, tasked with crafting the Afrofuturist costumes in “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” took home her second Oscar on Sunday night for costume design. Carter, who also won a statue for the 2018 film “Black Panther,” is not only the first Black woman to win two Academy Awards, but she is also the first person to win for both the original and the sequel of a movie. Onstage, she greeted audiences with a “Nice to see you again,” and thanked the academy for “recognizing the superhero that is a Black woman,” she said. “She endures, she loves, she overcomes.”\nCarter made history as the first Black woman to win an Oscar for costume design in 2019; she had received earlier nominations for Spike Lee’s “Malcolm X” and Steven Spielberg’s “Amistad.” Denzel Washington was the first Black man to win two Oscars — one in 1990 for “Glory” and another in 2002 for “Training Day.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/13/movies/ruth-carter-oscars-wakanda-forever.html"}
