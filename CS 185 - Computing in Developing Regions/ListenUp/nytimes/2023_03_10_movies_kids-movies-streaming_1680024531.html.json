Adapted from the Olivier- and Tony Award-winning stage musical, this version of Roald Dahl’s beloved book gives kids someone to root for (Alisha Weir as the brilliant, telekinetic Matilda Wormwood) and a delicious antagonist in the form of a cruel, shoulder-padded boarding school headmistress named Agatha Trunchbull (Thompson). Matilda comes into the world like any cute baby — only, as she tells us in her introductory song, where other children’s parents say things like “She’s an angel,” Matilda’s tell her she’s “a good case for population control.” She finds acceptance via a teacher, Miss Honey (Lashana Lynch), and pushes back against the tyranny of Trunchbull, her parents and any adult who tries to crush her spirit. You might not want your kids to revolt in real life if it means they refuse to brush their teeth or go to sleep at night, but introducing them to a hero who’s a precocious little girl, rebelling out of a desire to be loved for who she is, sounds pretty good.\n‘Turning Red’\nStream it on Disney+.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/10/movies/kids-movies-streaming.html"}
