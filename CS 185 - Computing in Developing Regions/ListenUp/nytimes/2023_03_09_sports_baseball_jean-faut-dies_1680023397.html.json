Blue Sox of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, died on Feb. 28 in Rock Hill, S.C. She was 98.\nHer death, in a hospice, was confirmed by her son Kevin Winsch.\nFaut (pronounced “fawt”) joined the league three years after it was introduced as a way to maintain public interest in baseball when many major league players had gone off to fight in World War II. The league was the subject of Penny Marshall’s acclaimed 1992 film, “A League of Their Own.”\nOver eight seasons, the right-handed Faut won 140 games, second to Helen Nicol Fox’s 163 for the most in the league’s history, and posted a minuscule 1.23 earned run average, a league record.\nShe was named the league’s player of the year in 1951, when the Blue Sox were playoff champions, and in 1953, her final season. She won at least 20 games three times.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/09/sports/baseball/jean-faut-dies.html"}
