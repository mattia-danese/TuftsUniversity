What might we gain from A.I.-created art? What might we lose?” Over 300 teenagers weighed in.\nNow we’re posing similar questions about writing. Someone recently brought the issue to the musician Nick Cave:\nI asked ChatGPT to write a song in the style of Nick Cave and this is what it produced. What do you think?\nYou can read the A.I.-created lyrics and Mr. Cave’s full response at his blog, The Red Hand Files, but here is some of what he said:\nChatGPT may be able to write a speech or an essay or a sermon or an obituary but it cannot create a genuine song. It could perhaps in time create a song that is, on the surface, indistinguishable from an original, but it will always be a replication, a kind of burlesque. Songs arise out of suffering, by which I mean they are predicated upon the complex, internal human struggle of creation and, well, as far as I know, algorithms don’t feel. Data doesn’t suffer. ChatGPT has no inner being, it has been nowhere, it has endured nothing, it has not had the audacity to reach beyond its limitations, and hence it doesn’t have the capacity for a shared transcendent experience, as it has no limitations from which to transcend. ChatGPT’s melancholy role is that it is destined to imitate and can never have an authentic human experience, no matter how devalued and inconsequential the human experience may in time become.\nIn a recent edition of her newsletter, Tressie McMillan Cottom, the Times Opinion columnist, says something similar:\nA.I. writes prose the way horror movies play with dolls. Chucky, Megan, the original Frankenstein’s monster. The monster dolls appear human and can even tell stories. But they cannot make stories. Isn’t that why they are monsters? They can only reflect humanity’s vanities back at humans. They don’t make new people or chart new horizons or map new experiences. They are carbon copies of an echo of the human experience.\nShe continues:\nEven when the essays are a good synthesis of other essays, written by humans, they are not human. Frankly, they creep me out precisely because they are so competent and yet so very empty. ChatGPT impersonates sentiment with sophisticated word choice but still there’s no élan. The essay does not invoke curiosity or any other emotion. There is a voice, but it is mechanical. It does not incite, offend or seduce. That’s because real voice is more than grammatical patternmaking.\nIf “This is a great time to think about the line between human and machine,” as Ms. McMillan Cottom says, what is that line? How do you see the “humanness” in the art you love? What makes it different from something created by a machine? Will A.I. ever be capable of creating real art? Will it replace human artists?\nAnd finally, how do these questions apply to learning and the role of schooling? If a machine can spit out a decent five-paragraph essay examining the causes of World War I or looking at symbolism in “The Bluest Eye,” why read and write and study the humanities? How might schools respond to this new technology not by doubling down on practices that can be easily gamed, but instead by helping students reach their full “humanness” through encouraging their original thinking and unique voices?", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/24/learning/lesson-plans/lesson-plan-teaching-and-learning-in-the-era-of-chatgpt.html"}
