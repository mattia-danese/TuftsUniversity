Cabbage fans turned out in force, deluging my inbox with tributes, recipes, a short story, even a poem. It warmed my cabbage-loving heart.\nThis cabbage dish is a mash-up of several recipes gleaned from those reader emails. It crosses a caramelized cabbage and onion sauté with a lasagnalike casserole. Think of it almost like a pork-based hybrid of Hungarian stuffed cabbage and Greek stuffed grape leaves.\nMy goal was to turn all those recipes into something that could be made in one large skillet.\nI also wanted to create a generous recipe that would use up an entire medium head of cabbage. That way, you wouldn’t have to wonder about what to do with a leftover wedge in the fridge.
