(Some employers may allow it, but they don’t have to and most don’t.) Workers end up taking out the money — either voluntarily or because they are pushed out by employers that don’t want to manage a glut of small accounts. Many don’t reinvest the cash, denting their retirement savings.\nThese “cash outs” can result in significant shortfalls in retirement savings, according to a 2020 report from the Employee Benefit Research Institute.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/10/your-money/retirement-401k-job-switching.html"}
