These deals will not affect the 2023 standings much. Some of the comings and goings of the free-agency period, however, are signs of larger trends that are reshaping how teams structure their rosters and payrolls.\nBargains on the Trading Block\nThe shrewdest maneuvers have been trades, not free-agent signings. Veterans on the trading block are often better players than the available free agents and can be acquired in exchange for midround draft picks and affordably replaced in a year or two, if things don’t work out.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/23/sports/football/nfl-free-agents.html"}
