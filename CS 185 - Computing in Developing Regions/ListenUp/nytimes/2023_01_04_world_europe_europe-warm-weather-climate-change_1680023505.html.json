In Rome, tourists and locals strolled in the sunshine in light sweaters. And in low-lying areas of the Pyrenees, a lack of snowfall forced some French ski resorts to close trails.\nThe unusually warm opening days of January broke dozens of weather records across Europe. Meteorologists called the warm spell and the records it broke “staggering,” as several countries saw the hottest start to the year ever measured.\nIn Brest, Belarus, for example, temperatures usually hover around freezing, but on New Year’s Day they hit a record 60.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or 15.9 Celsius. Temperatures in the Czech Republic on Monday, according to the national meteorology office, matched or broke records going back at least 30 years at 90 of 162 stations in the nation.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/04/world/europe/europe-warm-weather-climate-change.html"}
