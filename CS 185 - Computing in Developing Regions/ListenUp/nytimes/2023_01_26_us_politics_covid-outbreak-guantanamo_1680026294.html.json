But the other four defendants in the capital case have flulike symptoms and are in quarantine, the staff members said.\nAnother detainee accused of being a terrorist leader, an Indonesian man known as Hambali, who lives on the same tier as Mr. Mohammed, tested positive on Wednesday, forcing the cancellation of meetings between prisoners and defense lawyers scheduled for the rest of the week.\nThe outbreak apparently began in the adjacent Camp 6 prison, which holds 20 general population prisoners who have been approved for transfer with security assurances.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/26/us/politics/covid-outbreak-guantanamo.html"}
