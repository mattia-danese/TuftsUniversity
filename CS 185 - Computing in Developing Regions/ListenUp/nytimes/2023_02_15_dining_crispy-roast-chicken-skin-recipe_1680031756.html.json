If I’m organized, I can make this on a weeknight, seasoning the chicken about an hour before I want to roast it. But it’s better if I plan early in the morning or even the night before, so the bird can have a good long rest in the fridge, up to 24 hours.\nTo my usual garlic and salt seasoning mix, for this variation, I added grated fresh ginger for zip and a little toasted sesame oil for depth. Then I served it with a creamy sauce made from peanut butter and sesame oil.\nIf you have other things to do while the chicken roasts, you can skip the sauce and just serve the bird with some lime wedges on the side for brightness. But if you have a few minutes, the gingery sauce — velvety, piquant and spiked with more ginger and garlic — is worth whisking together.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/15/dining/crispy-roast-chicken-skin-recipe.html"}
