Dispensaries dot the landscape, with more than 400 in Oklahoma City alone.\nAnd thatâ€™s just for medical marijuana.\nOn Tuesday, voters across Oklahoma opted against going further, according to The Associated Press, rejecting a ballot initiative that would have legalized recreational marijuana use by adults 21 and over.\nWith the vote, Oklahoma joined a number of conservative states whose voters have recently decided against recreational marijuana legalization. Though Missouri approved a state constitutional amendment to allow for recreational marijuana in November, voters in other conservative states, including Arkansas, North Dakota and South Dakota, rejected similar proposals.\nThe vote on Tuesday was a setback for marijuana legalization proponents in Oklahoma who had anticipated that laissez-faire economic attitudes and growing support among younger Republicans would provide a pathway for the state to join a diverse assortment of 21 states and the District of Columbia in adopting legal recreational marijuana, from Alaska and the Mountain West to the coasts and parts of the Midwest.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/07/us/oklahoma-marijuana-ballot.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-cannabis&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&block=storyline_top_links_recirc"}
