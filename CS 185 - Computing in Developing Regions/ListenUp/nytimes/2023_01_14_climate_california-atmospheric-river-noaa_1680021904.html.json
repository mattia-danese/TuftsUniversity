The sonde, a tube of instruments about the size of a model rocket, was sucked out into the frigid air and began plummeting toward the clouds, where it would investigate the storm’s innards and transmit its findings to the world.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/14/climate/california-atmospheric-river-noaa.html"}
