That toll comes on the heels of 2022, one of the worst on record for large-scale weather and climate disasters around the United States, according to data released Tuesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n“It’s likely that this is going to be at least several billion dollars,” said Jonathan Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather. “It will unfortunately join the club of billion-dollar disasters.”\nThe nation was struck last year by 18 disasters that caused more than $1 billion each in damage. That’s the third-highest number in the 43 years that NOAA has been keeping records.\nThe only other years on record with more billion-dollar disasters, adjusted for inflation, are 2020 and 2021.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/10/us/california-storm-damage.html"}
