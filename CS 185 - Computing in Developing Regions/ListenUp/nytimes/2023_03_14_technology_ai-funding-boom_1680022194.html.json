Even as investors expect last week’s failure of Silicon Valley Bank, an institution that many tech start-ups relied on, to cast a pall over start-up funding, there is still a mismatch between the number of opportunities in artificial intelligence and the money available to fund them.\nThat’s because of the scarcity of A.I. companies and the potential of the technology. With few experts in the field, and most of them working at a handful of big tech companies, only a few generative A.I. start-ups — such as Stability AI and Jasper — have broken out. Investors desperate for the next big thing are competing fiercely to invest in these companies, offering some A.I. entrepreneurs nine-figure valuations for little more than an idea and a résumé.\n“We’re in that phase of the market where it’s, like, let 1,000 flowers bloom,” said Matt Turck, an investor who specializes in A.I. at the venture firm FirstMark. He added that the deal-making stood out in an otherwise dreary moment for tech marked by layoffs, cost-cutting and a drought of initial public offerings.\nAndreessen Horowitz did not respond to a request to comment. Index Ventures declined to comment on Mobius’s funding.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/14/technology/ai-funding-boom.html"}
