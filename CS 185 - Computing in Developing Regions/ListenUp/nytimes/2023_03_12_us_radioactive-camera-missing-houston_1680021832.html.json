It had not been found as of Sunday.\n“The radioactive material is sealed inside a capsule, which is in turn sealed inside the camera with protective shielding and other safety features,” the department said in a statement on Saturday.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/12/us/radioactive-camera-missing-houston.html"}
