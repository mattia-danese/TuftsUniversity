It was also her first nomination.\n“I wrote this book to honor the 6-year-old Viola,” Davis, 57, said at the podium. “To honor her life, her joy, her trauma, everything. And it has just been such a journey. I just EGOT!”\nIn 2015, Davis won the Emmy for best lead actress in a drama for her role in the ABC series “How to Get Away with Murder”; in 2017, she won the best supporting actress Oscar for “Fences,” the Denzel Washington-directed film, written by August Wilson, based on Wilson’s 1985 play; and she’s won two Tony Awards, for “King Hedley II,” in 2001, and “Fences,” in 2010.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/05/arts/music/viola-davis-egot-grammys.html"}
