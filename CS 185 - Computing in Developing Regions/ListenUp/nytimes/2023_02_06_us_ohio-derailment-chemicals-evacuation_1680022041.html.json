Mike DeWine of Ohio said on Monday at a news conference. “This is a matter of life and death.”\nHe added that there was “grave danger” of inhaling fumes from chemicals produced by the release, which the authorities identified as phosgene and hydrogen chloride. In high concentrations, both chemicals can cause severe and life-threatening respiratory issues.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/06/us/ohio-derailment-chemicals-evacuation.html"}
