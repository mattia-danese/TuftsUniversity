Though his credits were hardly going to win over critics — “Scary Movie 3” and “Scary Movie 4” as well as the second and third installments of the “Hangover” trilogy, among them — the calls from Hollywood executives kept coming. It was a steady and lucrative job.\nStill, there was something missing.\n“A lot of what I would be offered was stuff where they’re like, ‘Who can fix this thing?’” Mazin recalled in an interview late last month. “Or ‘Can somebody get it from a C-plus to a B-minus?’”\nEventually he decided that “I’m better than the work I’m being offered,” he said.\nThat was the first crucial step in what would become a remarkable midcareer ascent. Over the last four years, Mazin, 51, has spawned two hit HBO series and transformed himself from a comedy screenwriter into one of the hottest showrunners in premium scripted television.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/07/arts/television/the-last-of-us-craig-mazin.html"}
