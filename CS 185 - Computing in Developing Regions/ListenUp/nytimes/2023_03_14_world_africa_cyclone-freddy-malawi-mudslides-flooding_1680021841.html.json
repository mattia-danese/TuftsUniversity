I have not heard from her since.”\nCyclone Freddy, a record-breaking storm that barreled into the landlocked southeast African nation of Malawi over the weekend, brought a deluge of mud and floodwaters that has left nearly 200 people dead.\nIn a shelter in Blantyre on Tuesday, Alinafe, her youngest sibling strapped to her back, was among dozens of Malawians anxiously awaiting news of their missing loved ones.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/14/world/africa/cyclone-freddy-malawi-mudslides-flooding.html"}
