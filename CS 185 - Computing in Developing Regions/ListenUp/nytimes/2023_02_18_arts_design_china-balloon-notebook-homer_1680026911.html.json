There’s a very lyrical approach to it, a kind of poetics of description, lighting, materials.”\nSo did Petty Officer Thompson get lucky, or is he that good?\nThe answer, unsurprisingly, is both. Thompson, who will celebrate his 33rd birthday later this week, spent a year in art school and worked as a graphic designer before joining the Navy in 2012 — expressly, he says, to “take pictures of things that matter.”\n“I had an idea in my head about what makes a good photograph,” he said in a phone call on Sunday. “I was just trying to execute it on about zero hours of sleep.” He acknowledges, though, how significant a role luck played as well.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/18/arts/design/china-balloon-notebook-homer.html"}
