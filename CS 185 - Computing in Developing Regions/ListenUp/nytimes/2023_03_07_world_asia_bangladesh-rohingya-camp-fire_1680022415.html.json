There, more than a million live in overcrowded refugee camps so miserable that many have taken to the sea in makeshift boats, with hundreds lost, and presumed drowned, in the treacherous Bay of Bengal.\nThis week, for thousands of Camp 11 residents, the misery deepened. About 2,000 makeshift settlements — mostly assembled from bamboo and blue plastic tarpaulins — were destroyed in a fire that tore through the camp on Sunday night, leaving 12,000 refugees scrambling for shelter.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/07/world/asia/bangladesh-rohingya-camp-fire.html"}
