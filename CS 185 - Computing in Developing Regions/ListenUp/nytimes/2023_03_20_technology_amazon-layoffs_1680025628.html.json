Those two segments of the business are much higher-margin operations than Amazon’s core retail business, according to financial analysts and filings.\nMr. Jassy wrote that the annual planning session that the company’s leaders wrapped up last week had focused on streamlining costs and head count.\n“The overriding tenet of our annual planning this year was to be leaner while doing so in a way that enables us to still invest robustly in the key long-term customer experiences that we believe can meaningfully improve customers’ lives and Amazon as a whole,” he wrote.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/20/technology/amazon-layoffs.html"}
