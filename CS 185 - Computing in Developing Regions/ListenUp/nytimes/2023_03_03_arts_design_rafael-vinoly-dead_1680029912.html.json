He was 78.\nThe cause was an aneurysm, said his son, Roman, who is a director at the firm.\nMr. Viñoly, a modernist, was not known for a signature style. But he did have a penchant for enclosing large spaces under glass, creating luminous interiors. His addition to the Cleveland Museum of Art, his Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts in Philadelphia and his Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago all feature dramatic glass-roofed courtyards.\nIn New York, Mr. Viñoly may have been best known for 432 Park Avenue, a condo tower that, at nearly 1,400 feet, was briefly the tallest residential building in the world. Its gridded exterior has been praised by critics for its restrained elegance, even as it has been faulted for encroaching on Manhattan’s skyline.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/03/arts/design/rafael-vinoly-dead.html"}
