Medical workers trying to revive him for 10 minutes. Teammates in tears. An ambulance carrying him off to a hospital.\nMy prayer, aside from seeing Hamlin leave that Cincinnati hospital able to live a fruitful, productive life, is that we never watch a single snap of an N.F.L. game the same way again.\nToo often, too many of us, myself included, watch the N.F.L. with narrow vision. We focus on what we can get out of these games, the diverting enjoyment, while playing down the risks to those like Hamlin who have steeled themselves to endure the pain and face the danger inherent to football.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/03/sports/football/nfl-broadcast-fans.html"}
