And Ukraine’s defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said his armed forces had also welcomed “a new addition to our armored units” — Challenger tanks from Britain.\nIt is a highly anticipated delivery of advanced equipment as Ukraine prepares for an expected spring offensive.\nThe German-made Leopard 2 is more advanced than the Soviet-era tanks that Ukraine has relied on in battle so far. Leopard tanks have been used by the German Army for decades and by the militaries of more than a dozen other European nations. That includes Poland, which had already delivered Leopard tanks to Kyiv after prodding its allies to provide more advanced equipment to Ukraine’s military.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/27/world/europe/ukraine-challenger-leopard-2-tanks.html"}
