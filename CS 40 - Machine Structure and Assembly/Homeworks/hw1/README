We received help from numerous TAs during office hours mostly regarding
memory errors and utilizing Hanson structures.

    We used the Pnmrdr Interface to get pxi


  readaline
    We initially planned to implement readaline with a Hanson List. Upon not
    getting the List_toArray method to work and getting advice from a TA to 
    consider using another Hanson structure, we decided to use Hanson Sequences
    instead. We looped through the provided stream and accessed each character, 
    storing in a Hanson Sequence if it is a valid word character. The loop breaks
    out if a newline characer is read or EOF is reached. The program then converts
    the contents of the Hanson Sequence to a char *, assigns it to *datapp, and
    returns the line's byte count. This implementation works completely without
    any errors or memory leaks.
