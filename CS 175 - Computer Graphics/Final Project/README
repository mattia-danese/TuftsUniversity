Name of project: 3D Etch-A-Sketch

Description of project: This project allows users to create and manipulate
objects in 3D space. They can create the four different basice shapes we've
used throughout the semester: cube, sphere, cone, and cylinder, and users
can drag them around the scene (ie translate), scale, and rotate them about the
axes. Users can then output these scenes to the xml format we've used throughout
this class.

Known bugs: Scaled cubes, cylinders, and spheres don't drag correctly. Rotation
followed by dragging is treated as undefined behavior.

How to compile: make

How to run: ./final
