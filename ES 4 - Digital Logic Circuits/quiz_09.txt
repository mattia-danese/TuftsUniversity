Please don't delete any of the existing text; you'll make the grader fail.
For multiple choice, just put an 'x' or some other character in the brackets


1)  Equation 3.14 calculates
(select one)
[ ] The clock period as a function of the flip-flip and combinational logic delays
[X] The combinational logic delay as a function of flip-flop delays and clock period
[ ] The sequencing overhead as a function of combinational logic delay and clock period
[ ] The maximum clock frequency as a function of the sequencing overhead


2)  Hold time constraints are...
(select one)
[ ] Relatively unimportant, and the remainder of the book does not cover them
[ ] Somewhat important, because they force you to run a circuit more slowly
[X] Critically important, because they can only be fixed by changing the circuit
[ ] Hyper-important, and the primary timing issue we'll deal with going forward


3)  A synchronizer is necessary when:
(select one)
[ ] A sequential circuit accepts and input from the outside world
[ ] Two outputs must be synchronized (e.g., clock and data)
[ ] Clock skew becomes too large
[X] All of the above


4)  The book discusses two types of parallelism.  Briefly describe the difference between them.
(free response)

    One form of parallelism is spatial parallelism.
    Spatial parallelism deals with multiple copies of the same hardware doing the same task at
    the same time.

    The other form of parallelism is temporal parallelism.
    Temporal parallelism deals with a task being broken down into smaller tasks, called stages,
    where a different instance of a task will be at each stage at any moment.

5)  What questions do you have about this material?
(free response)

I have no questions on this material.
