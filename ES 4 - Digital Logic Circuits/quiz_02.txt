For multiple choice, just put an 'x' or some other character in the brackets



1)  Which of the following are true, based on the theorems given in the book?
(select all that apply)
[X] AND is associative
[X] OR is associative
[X] AND distributes over OR
[X] OR distributes over AND


2)  DeMorgan's theorem states that
(select one)
[ ] !(A + B) = AB
[X] !(A + B) = !A!B
[ ] !(A + B) = !(AB)
[ ] !(A + B) = !A + !B


3)  In a boolean equation, what is a prime implicant?
(select one)
[ ] A term which contains each variable exactly once
[ ] The first term in the equation
[ ] A term which is a dual of another (indicated with a prime: "'" )
[X] A term which cannot be combined and simplified with any others


4)  Which of the following does the book mention as guidelines for drawing circuits?
(select all that apply)
[ ] When a circuit contains both AND and OR gates, the AND gates should be on top
[X] Straight lines are better than jaggy ones
[X] Wires always connect at a T junction
[ ] Never use diagonal lines
[X] Whenever possible, gates should flow from left to right


5)  Bubble pushing primarily uses which theorems?  (Refer back to section 2.3.3)
(select one)
[ ] Distributivity and null element
[X] DeMorgan's and involution
[ ] Covering and involution
[ ] Covering and null element
[ ] DeMorgan's and identity


6)  Which of the following are meanings for 'X' in a logic context?
   Hopefully now you see why we didn't use 'X' to label the output of a circuit!
(select all that apply)
[X] A truth table input which doesn't matter ("don't care")
[X] An illegal value ("contention")
[X] An uninitialized value in simulation
[ ] A circuit pin which is disconnected
[ ] A "high impedance" state


7)  What's the point of using a gray code when labeling a Karnaugh map?
(select one)
[ ] It requires fewer steps than a binary code
[X] It makes adjacent cells differ in only one variable
[ ] It makes your logic more robust (i.e., if your count is off by one, it's ok)
[ ] Some kittens are gray


8)  In a Karnaugh map with 'X's, you should:
(select one)
[ ] Not include the 'X's
[ ] Include all of the 'X's, as if they were '1'
[X] Include 'X's that simplify the logic, and ignore the rest
[ ] This is nonsense; a Karnaugh map should never have 'X's


9)  What questions do you have about this material?
(free response)

I don't have any questions.
