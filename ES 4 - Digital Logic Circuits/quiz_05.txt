For multiple choice, just put an 'x' or some other character in the brackets



1)  How many bits are in a word?
(select one)
[ ] 8
[ ] 16
[ ] 32
[ ] 64
[X] It depends on the processor.


2)  Write 0x32 (hexadecimal 32) in decimal:
(integer)
50


3)  Which of the following are shortcomings of sign-magnitude representation, as compared to 2's complement?
(select all that apply)
[ ] Negating a number requires changing many bits
[X] Zero has more than one representation
[X] Addition doesn't work the same way as unsigned addition
[ ] It is not straightforward to determine whether a value is negative
[ ] Only half as many numbers can be represented


4)  What is the smallest (most negative) value that can be represented with an 8-bit two's complement number?
(integer)
-128

5)  Structural modeling is a way of describing:
(select one)
[ ] the structure of a module, obviously
[X] how a module is composed of smaller modules
[ ] how a module's outputs are controlled by its inputs
[ ] the intermediate signals in a module
[ ] how a module should be replicated


6)  What is wrong with this instantiation of `tristate`? (See Example 4.15)

  mytristate : tristate
    port map(not d0, s, y);

(select all that apply)
[ ] A semicolon is missing
[ ] The name `mytristate` is invalid
[X] "not d0" cannot be used here
[ ] The types of the variables do not match the ports


7)  The set of inputs and corresponding desired output patterns are known as
(select one)
[ ] test cases
[ ] use cases
[X] test vectors
[ ] truth tables
[ ] overhead


8)  The textbook observes that writing testbenches can be very tedious.  What do the authors say is a better way?
(select one)
[X] Using a testbench that reads from a file
[ ] Formal verification
[ ] Avoiding writing complex modules
[ ] There isn't a better way, just deal with it
