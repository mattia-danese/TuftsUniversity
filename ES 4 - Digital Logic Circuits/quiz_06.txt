For multiple choice, just put an 'x' or some other character in the brackets


1)  The addition circuit you built in lab 2 is a:
(select one)
[X] Full adder
[ ] Ripple-carry adder
[ ] Carry-lookahead adder
[ ] Prefix adder
[ ] Something else


2)  What hardware is necessary to perform subtraction?
(select one)
[ ] Just an adder
[X] An adder plus a bank of inverters
[ ] An adder, a bank of inverters, and a second simplified adder that just adds 1
[ ] A completely separate piece of hardware, since it needs to borrow instead of carry


3)  Comparing the magnitude of numbers is usually done by:
(select one)
[ ] A minimized logical function of the input bits, as in lab 1
[ ] Examining the most significant bits of each number
[X] Subtracting one from the other and looking at the sign
[ ] AND-ing the result of XNOR-ing all the corresponding bits of each number


4)  In the example ALU design, the ALUControl signals determine:
(select all that apply)
[X] Which function is computed
[ ] Which function is selected as the output
[X] What output flags to set
[ ] The order of the operands


5)  What happens when the 'S' input of an SR latch goes from 0 to 1?
(select one)
[ ] Q gets the value of R
[X] Q becomes 1, as long as R is 0.
[ ] Q always gets the value 0
[ ] Q flips its value from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0


6)  A D latch copies D to Q whenever:
(select one)
[ ] D changes
[ ] D has a rising edge
[ ] The clock has a rising edge
[X] The clock is high


7)  A D flip-flip copies D to Q whenever:
(select one)
[ ] D changes
[X] D has a rising edge
[ ] The clock has a rising edge
[ ] The clock is high


8)  Which of the following are required for a circuit to be a synchronous sequential circuit?
(select all that apply)
[X] At least one circuit element is a register
[ ] There are no feedback paths (cycles)
[X] All registers receive the same clock signal
[ ] Any outputs are connected directly to registers (not the result of combinational logic)



9)  What questions do you have about this material?
(free response)

I do not have any questions about this material.
