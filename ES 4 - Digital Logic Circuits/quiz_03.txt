For multiple choice, just put an 'x' or some other character in the brackets



1)  A multiplexer is sometimes also called a:
(select one)
[ ] priority encoder
[X] mux
[ ] MXOR
[ ] tristate buffer


2)  How many select lines would be needed for a 16:1 multplexer?
(integer)
4

3)  A multiplexer can be used to compute arbitrary logic functions by:
(select one)
[ ] applying inputs which access the AND and OR gates inside the multiplexer
[X] wiring the inputs to 0 or 1 based on the truth table
[ ] driving the inputs with a decoder
[ ] using an AND gate on the output to combine the maxterms



4)  A decoder can be combined with what to compute arbitrary logic functions?
(select one)
[ ] AND gate
[X] OR gate
[ ] Multiplexer
[ ] Another decoder


5)  Contamination delay is 
(select all that apply)
[X] Always less than the propagation delay
[ ] Always greater than or equal to the propagation delay
[X] The maximum duration of time that the output is an unsteady state
[ ] The minimum time from an input change to an output change


6)  Propagation and contamination delays may vary based on:
(select all that apply)
[X] The temperature of the chip(s)
[X] The length and path of wires inside the chip
[X] The speed of indivdual gates
[ ] The day of the week


7)  Which of the three multiplexer implementations has the lowest data-to-output propagation delay?
(select one)
[ ] Two-level logic (AND/OR)
[X] Tristate
[ ] Hierarchical


8)  What does the book say is the point of understanding glitches?
(select one)
[ ] Only some components can handle glitches; it's important to know what you're working with
[ ] So they can be recognized and eliminated
[X] So you know what you're looking at on the oscillsope or simulation waveform
[ ] There isn't a point; it's just an excuse to talk about circuit delays



9)  What questions do you have about this material?
(free response)
I have no questions.
