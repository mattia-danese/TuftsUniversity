For multiple choice, just put an 'x' or some other character in the brackets


1)  To create a flip-flop which takes the signal `d` as input, the sensitivity list should be:
(select one)
[ ] (no sensitivity)
[ ] (all)
[ ] (d)
[ ] (clk, d)
[X] (clk)


2)  T/F: multiple process blocks are necessary if you want to describe multiple flip-flops in a design.
(select one)
[ ] True
[X] False


3)  T/F: Every process with a non-empty sensitivity list creates a flip-flop.
(select one)
[ ] True
[X] False


4)  To create combinational logic which takes the signal `d` as input, what should the sensitivity list be? (There are two right answers, but the book specifically says one is better, see section 4.5)
(select one)
[ ] (no sensitivity)
[X] (all)
[ ] (d)
[ ] (clk, d)
[ ] (clk)


5)  A counter consists of
(select one)
[X] A register and an adder
[ ] A flip-flop and an adder
[ ] A register and an ALU
[ ] A flip-flop and an ALU


6)  A shift register
(select all that apply)
[X] Multiplies and divides by shifting bits left or right
[X] Is a kind of serial-to-parallel converter
[ ] Stores the shift amount and controls the behavior of a shifter
[X] Is a string of flip-flops connected in series
