For multiple choice, just put an 'x' or some other character in the brackets


1)  An FSM consists of:
(select all that apply)
[X] Next-state logic
[ ] Input logic
[X] Output logic
[X] A register (bank of flip-flops)
[ ] A bank of latches


2)  Ben's FSM will transition from S1 to S2 when:
(select one)
[ ] Ta has a rising edge
[ ] Either Ta or Tb has a rising edge
[X] There is a rising clock edge
[ ] There is a rising clock edge and Ta is high


3)  Does the choice of state encodings matter?
(select one)
[ ] No, everything works out identically (like variable ordering on a K-map)
[ ] No, the intermediate steps are different but the function is the same
[X] Yes, the function is the same but the circuit might use more or fewer gates
[ ] Yes, changing the state encoding may completely change the circuit function


4)  A Moore state machine typically has
(select one)
[X] More states than an equivalent Mealy machine
[ ] Fewer states than an equivalent Mealy machine
[ ] The same number of states, but more complex combinational logic
[ ] The same number of states, but simpler combinational logic


5)  The book states that a VHDL enumeration data type is used for the states because
(select all that apply)
[ ] The state can't be represented with std_logic_vector
[X] It makes the code more readable
[X] It makes the code easier to change
[ ] It uses fewer bits


6)  What questions do you have about this material?
