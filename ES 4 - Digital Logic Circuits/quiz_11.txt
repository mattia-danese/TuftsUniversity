For multiple choice, just put an 'x' or some other character in the brackets


1)  The ARM architecture described in the book defines how many registers?
(select one)
[ ] 2
[ ] 8
[X] 16
[ ] 32
[ ] 64


2)  The STR operation does what?
(select one)
[ ] Creates an empty string
[X] Stores a register to a memory location
[ ] Enables ARM's "strict address mode"
[ ] Stirs all the registers around in a kind of stew


3)  Which of the following operations execute conditially?
(select all that apply)
[ ] ADD
[X] BEQ
[ ] BLE
[ ] CMP
[X] MOVGE


4)  Branches can be used to implement
(select all that apply)
[X] if-statements
[X] if/else-if/else statements (elif, elsif, else if, depending on the language)
[X] case statements
[X] for loops
[X] while loops


5)  In ARM assembly, data-processing immediates are stored in:
(select one)
[ ] 32 bits appended to the (32-bit) instruction
[X] The least significant 8 bits of the instruction, as a binary number
[ ] The least significant 12 bits of the instruction, as a binary number and a shift
[ ] A register


6)  The destination register for data-processing instructions is specified by:
(select one)
[ ] bits 31:28
[ ] bits 19:16
[X] bits 15:12
[ ] bits 3:0


7)  When the processor takes a branch, it jumps to a new address.  How is this address (known as the branch target address, or BTA) stored?
(select one)
[ ] As a 24-bit absolute address
[ ] As a 20-bit address and a 4-bit shift (allowing values up to 32 bits total)
[ ] As a 24-bit address difference between the BTA and the PC+8
[X] As a 24-bit count of the number of instructions between the BTA and the PC+8


8)  What questions do you have about this material?
