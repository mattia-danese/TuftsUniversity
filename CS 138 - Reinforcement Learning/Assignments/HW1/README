How to run:
  python3 script.py

How to use:
  - set 'use_constant_step_size' to True to run bandits with the constant 
    step-size method where alpha = 'step_size',
    otherwise set to False to run bandits with sample average method
  - set 'decrease_epsilon' to False to keep a constant epsilon of 0.1,
    otherwise set to True and epsilon will decrease by 50% every 1000 time steps
    (second experiment)
