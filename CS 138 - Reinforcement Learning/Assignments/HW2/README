How to run:
  python3 script.py

How to use:
  - Running normally will result in 1000 episodes (no retries during episodes)
    and then the plot of average reward per episode will be generated.
    
  - In order to evaluate greedy policy (i.e. strictly follow policy), uncomment
    lines 171 onwards and re-run. 
    This will run normally (1000 episodes, no retires, and average reward plot)
    and will also print to console the agent's steps in the optimal path it found.

  - Specify the racetrack textfile to read in on line 24
    Note: my parsing logic assumes the invariant that racetrack files must have 
          0's as barriers, 1's as valid positions, 2's as the starting line, and
          3's as the finish line 

  - In order to enable retry-ability, set 'retry_enabled' to True on line 48 

Dependencies needed:
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
