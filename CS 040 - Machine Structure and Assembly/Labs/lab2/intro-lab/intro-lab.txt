This file goes with part 8 of the first lab.  The idea is to give you
some practice thinking about the names of functions.  The problem is a
simple one, so we're doing the software equivalent of shooting a fly
with an elephant gun, but because the problem is so simple, it makes
it easy to have a short practice session.

Here is the problem:

  - Suggest three different functions that might be useful in
    implementing `brightness`.

  - For each function, suggest three possible names.

  - For each function, say which name you think is most appropriate
    and *why*.



Function #1: fileProcessing

  Job: Declares a FILE type and instantiates it to the file pointer returned
       by fopen(). Checks for file based errors. Creates an instance of
       Pnmrdr_T to read file and access file info, checks for any errors based
       on file type.

  Candidate names: fileSetup, fileProcessing, fileErrorCheck

  Best name: fileSetup

  Why the given name is the best: Clearly and specifically describes what is 
  going on in the function.





Function #2: brightnessCalc

  Job: Loops over all pixels in the image, collecting brightness info,
       converting brightness values into 'double' form, and averaging all
       the values. Prints out total average brightness of image.

  Candidate names: brightnessCalc, dataCollection, imageProcessing

  Best name: brightnessCalc

  Why the given name is the best: Main purpose of function is to calculate
  brightness of image





Function #3: errorThrow

  Job: Prints the passed string to sdterr and exits program with EXIT_FAILURE

  Candidate names: errorOutput, errorThrow, exitProgram

  Best name: errorThrow

  Why the given name is the best: Simple and accurate, literally throws an eror
