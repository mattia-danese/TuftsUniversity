Architecture:
    40image.c is the main driver of the program. It takes files to be compressed
    or decompressed according to the command line arguements. It then calls
    the appropriate compression or decompression functions and outputs the 
    compressed or decompressed file to standard output.

    pack.c is the compression module. It contains a parent function where
    all other functions partaining to this module are called. It takes in a 
    original image in ppm format and outputs a lossly compressed version of it.

    unpack.c is the decompression module. It contains a parent function where
    all other functions partaining to this module are called. It takes in a 
    compressed file and outputs the corresponding ppm.

    bitpack.c contains functions regarding bit-wise arithmetic for bit-packing
    used in both pack.c and unpack.c

We have thank the TAs a lot for helping us with bugs, especially Ann Marie for 
staying really on Friday.

Everything to our knowledge has been implemented correctly.
